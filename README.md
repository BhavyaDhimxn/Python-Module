# Python-Module 🚀  

This repository documents my **Python learning journey**, starting from the **basics of Python (Day 1)** and progressing towards **Python for DevOps**. The goal is to build strong programming fundamentals and then apply them in real-world DevOps workflows.  

---

## 📅 Progress Tracker  

- **Day 1 & 2** – Python Basics (syntax, variables, data types, input/output)    
- **Day3** - Python Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, identity, membership)
- **Day4** - Conditional Statements (if, else, elif)
- **Day5** - Loops (for, while, nested loops, break, continue)
- **Day6** - Data Structures (List, indexing, slicing, list operation)
- **Day7** - Data Structures (Tuple, memory comparison, __sizeof__(), sys.getsizeof(), Tuple modification)
- **Day8** - Data Structures (Set, Dictionaries, Operations on set and dictionary)
- **Day9** - Functions (function definition, syntax, types of arguements)

## 📖 Learning Path  

The repository will evolve through different stages:  

1. **Core Python** – variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, modules.  
2. **Intermediate Python** – file handling, exceptions, OOP, standard libraries.  
3. **Advanced Python** – iterators, generators, decorators, context managers.  
4. **Python for DevOps** –  
   - Writing automation scripts  
   - Working with Linux system commands  
   - File & log management  
   - APIs and REST interactions  
   - Using Python with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS  
   - Building CI/CD pipelines with Python automation
